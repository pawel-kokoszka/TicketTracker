Hi, this is my pet project used as learning platform for developing ASP.net Core web application.

Ticket Tracker will be simple application for managing tickets used usually by teams working as IT operations support lines.

Features status:
- main use case of creating ticket and processing it is working
- notes for tickets are working
- history for tickets is working, but is limited to most important ticket properties for now
- gui for displaying and processing tickets is working in most basic way
- app user authentication and authorization is working

ToDo:
- gui for all application admin features

WiP:
- deployment on Azure
- CI/CD setup with Azure devops
